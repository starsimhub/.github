# Welcome to Starsim!

Starsim is an agent-based framework for modeling the spread of diseases among agents via dynamic transmission networks.

See [starsim.org](https://starsim.org) for more information, or go straight to the [docs](https://docs.starsim.org) if you're ready to dive in.

We aim to make all our code open source, including [Starsim](https://github.com/starsimhub/starsim) itself, plus models implemented in Starsim such as [STIsim](https://github.com/starsimhub/stisim) and [HPVsim](https://github.com/starsimhub/hpvsim). We also welcome contributions from the community -- if you've built a model using Starsim, please get in touch!
